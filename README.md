# Manual Provisioning Project (Beginner DevOps)

This project demonstrates a simple **manual provisioning workflow** on Linux using an HTML template from Tooplate. It is part of my learning journey as an **upcoming DevOps engineer**.

## 📌 Project Overview

* Set up and provision a Linux environment manually
* Added and customized an HTML template
* Organized the project for future automation (Ansible/Vagrant in later stages)
* Version-controlled everything using Git and pushed to GitHub

This project serves as my foundational hands-on practice in DevOps.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Linux (Ubuntu/CentOS)** – environment setup
* **HTML Template (Tooplate)** – static website used for provisioning
* **Git & GitHub** – version control and documentation
* **Terminal/Bash** – manual provisioning steps

## 📝 What I Did

* Created project folder structure
* Added template files (HTML, CSS, JS)
* Initialized Git repository
* Committed all project files
* Created GitHub repo and pushed the project
* Documented each step for learning purposes

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd project-folder
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
   **or**

   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

## 🎯 Goal of This Project

This project marks the beginning of my DevOps path.
I am learning:

* How to provision resources manually
* How to structure small projects
* How to use Git the right way
* How to document my work for others to understand
